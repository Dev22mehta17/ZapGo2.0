# Enhanced Route Summary Feature

## Overview
The route planner now includes a comprehensive route summary that shows both ZapGo registered charging stations and intermediate cities along the journey, providing users with a complete picture of their route coverage and charging options.

## Features Added

### 1. Mixed Route Visualization
- **ZapGo Stations**: Real charging stations from the database marked as "Registered"
- **Intermediate Cities**: Simulated city points along the route marked as "Not Registered"
- **Smart Spacing**: Intermediate cities are generated every 20km along the route for optimal visualization
- **Realistic Names**: Uses common Indian city names relevant to the region

### 2. Enhanced Route Summary Display
- **Status Badges**: Clear visual indicators showing "Registered" (green) vs "Not Registered" (red)
- **Booking Integration**: "Book Now" buttons only appear for registered ZapGo stations
- **Distance Information**: Each point shows its distance from the starting point
- **Charging Recommendations**: Smart recommendations for registered stations based on vehicle range

### 3. Visual Differentiation
- **Color Coding**: 
  - Green badges for registered ZapGo stations
  - Red badges for non-registered intermediate cities
  - Yellow icons for charging stations
  - Blue icons for intermediate cities
- **Interactive Elements**: Book buttons only on reachable registered stations
- **Map Markers**: Different marker types for different location types

## Example Route Summary

For a route from **Patiala** to **Chandigarh**, the system will show:

```
Journey Steps:
üèÅ Patiala (Origin)
‚ö° ZapGo Rajpura (15.2 km) - Registered - Book Now
üìç Bahadurgarh City (20.0 km) - Not Registered
üìç Rajpura Town (40.0 km) - Not Registered  
‚ö° ZapGo Banur (60.0 km) - Registered - Book Now
üìç Zirakpur Village (80.0 km) - Not Registered
‚ö° ZapGo Chandigarh (95.0 km) - Registered - Book Now
üéØ Chandigarh (Destination)
```
